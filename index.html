            <p>
            Art is really fun because you can express yourself with cool techniques that can make masterpieces. Art isn't only painting or drawing. It can also be music. Music is another form of art because you can be creative in your own way with melodies and beats. Martial Arts and dancing is also another form of art because it allows you be expressive with moves in patterns.

            My favorite things to draw, paint and color are animals, world landmarks, and floral art.
                Animals are very fun because I can make my own create animals. Some that are extinct or even ones that don't even exist. I love to draw landmarks like the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower because then I have a piece of the world's wonders at my fingertips. Guess what , I drew it. I paint floral art because I can make flowers of plants with unique colors. I sometimes use drawing videos or just look at pictures online to draw.

            My inspiration for art is the world and Leonardo da Vinci. The world is one of my inspirations because there is a lot of beauty and wonder in the world so why not add a bit of creative of the world on to a piece of paper. Leonardo da Vinci is another one of my inspirations. He was the one that inspired to make realistic drawing as Leo did with Mona Lisa.
